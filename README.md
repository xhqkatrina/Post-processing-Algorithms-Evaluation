+ Project summary: In this project, we created an OCR post-processing procedure to enhance Tesseract OCR output. We discusssed and researched the assigned paper D2 and C4, for the detection algorithm and correction algorithm separately. For error detection, we utilized letter n-gram algorithm，comparing all possible bigrams of all words in Tesseract with positional binary matrix constructed from Ground Truth. For error correction part, we focused on probability scoring with contextual constraints, using Bayesian probability to find the correction type with highest prior probability multiplied by probability of it being a typo given the correction. Different methods of estimations such as GT, MLE, and ELE are performed. Performance evaluation is to compare the correction accuracy of different methods of estimations by calculating the proportion of errors before and after correction.

**Final result of our evaluation**
